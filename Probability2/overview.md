### Periodicity in markoc chains

Proposition: Periodicity
- Definition of Periodicity (partion, transtions, max value d, aperiodic)

### Invariant Probability

-

- reversability \[[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V7srmmOu6k)\]

### Definition Recurrence

- recurrent / transient+
- positive recurrent / null recurrent (examples in lecture)

- Theorem 1.6 (positive recurrent iff $\pi$ normalized to probability measure)

- Theorem 1.7 Ergodic Theorem \[[source](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math2750/S11-long-term-chains.html)\]

- Theorem 1.8 (Relation between invariant probability and Expected value)

- Theorem 1.9 (null recurrent, transient state, $\lim_{n\to x\infty}P(X_n = i) = 0$)
