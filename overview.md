## Def: Optimization Problem

Let $C \in R^n$ and mapping $f: C\to R \cup \{+ \infty \}$. 
Then an optimization problem (OP) is defined with: 
$$\min_{x\in C} f(x)$$

We are looking for $x^*\in C$ such that
$f(x^*)\leq f(x) \forall x \in C$

TODO: ...

## 1D case

Let $C = I = [a,b]$ with $a < b$, and $f \in C(I,R)$ ~convex and continues functions

OP: $min_{x\in I}f(x)$
### Q1: Does OP has at least one solution?

-> Yes: A continues function on a non empty compact set has at least one solution

TODO: proof

### Q2: If $f \in C'([a,b])$ find a condition satisfied by $x^*$

### Q3: if moreover $f \in C^2([a,b])$ what can we say about $f^{'}(x^*)$ and $f^{''}(x^*)$

### Q4: Let $f:I \to R\cup \{+\infty\}$
- Prop: be convex with $I \neq \empty$
